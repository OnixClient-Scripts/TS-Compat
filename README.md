# TypeScript type definitions for Onix Client scripting.

## Setup
- Clone this repo into your `Scripts` folder.
- Run `npm run setup` or `yarn setup` in this folder.
- Afterwards, run `npm install` or `yarn` in the Scripts folder.
- Make your scripts in their corresponding folers in `onix-scripting-ts/`
- To build your scripts, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`

## TODO:
- Make a script to automatically generate type definitions from the Autocomplete folder
- Easier setup
